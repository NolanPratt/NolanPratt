# Hey, Iâ€™m Nolan ðŸ‘‹
I enjoy solving complex problems and implementing real-world solutions by utilizing my foundational knowledge within the field, which has been gathered through years of academic and professional experience.

I have a diverse background in the STEM field, alongside various career experiences, wherein I studied physics and aerospace engineering, and I am currently in my final year as a computer science student. Because of my many experiences, my interests range widely from embedded systems, machine learning, retail systems autonomy, and data analytics, to web design and video game development.

I am currently open to furthering my professional experience in software development, so feel free to reach out with any opportunities that you may think align with my interests!
