- 👋 Hi, I’m @NolanPratt. I am a passionate and curious junior developer. I am currently attending Southern New Hampshire University as a student within the Computer Science discipline with a concentration in Data Analysis. I am in my junior year with an expected graduation window in June 2024.

- 👀 I am interested in Machine Learning and Embedded Systems Engineering. I am searching for my first software engineering position to gain work experience within my discipline and to also learn from a knowledgeable team to promote my own development as a Software Engineer.

- ✔ I have covered the following languages and technologies in practice: C++, Java, Python, R, SQL, & MATLAB.

- 🐱‍🏍 I am currently learning about data structure and algorithm implementation within professional system design, while also covering 3D software techniques using OpenGL, Unreal Engine, and Blender.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any software engineers who enjoy the learning experience as I do and anyone who would like to provide roadmap or career insight.
