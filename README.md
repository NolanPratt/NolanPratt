- 👋 Hi, I’m @NolanPratt. I am a passionate and curious junior developer. I am currently attending Southern New Hampshire University as a student within the Computer Science discipline with a concentration in Data Analysis. I am in my junior year with an expected graduation window of May 2024.

- 👀 I am interested in Machine Learning and Embedded Systems Engineering. I am searching for my first software engineering position to gain work experience within my discipline and to also learn from a knowledgeable team to promote my own development as a Software Engineer.

- ✔ I have covered the following languages in practice: C++, Java, Python, & HTML. My currently proficiency level involves the following concepts and more: branches and loops, basic data structures, comprehensions, file handling, exception handling, normal and abstract classes, objects, and memory addressing and pointers.

- 🐱‍🏍 I am currently learning about the software development life cycle in practice, while also covering my first database technology in Structured Query Language.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any software engineers who enjoy the early learning experience as I do and anyone who would like to provide insight.
