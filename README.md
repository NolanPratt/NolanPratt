- 👋 Hi, I’m @NolanPratt. I am a passionate and curious junior developer. I am currently attending Southern New Hampshire University as a student within the Computer Science discipline with a concentration in Data Analysis.

- 👀 I am interested in Machine Learning and Embedded Systems Engineering. I am searching for my first Junior Software Engineering position to gain work experience within my discipline and to also learn from a knowledgeable team in order to promote my own development as a Software Engineer.

- 🌱 I’m currently studying Python software development. I have covered loops, conditionals, basic data structures, comprehensions, and file handling. I'm now focused on learning data collections and using mapping and filtering techniques.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any software engineers who enjoy the early learning experience as I do and anyone who would like to provide insight to further my Python development understanding.
